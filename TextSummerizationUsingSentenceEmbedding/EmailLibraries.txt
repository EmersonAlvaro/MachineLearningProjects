nope use \\
generally
set dir with iscir
 
[?4/?8/?2019 1:42 PM]  Anujay Saraf:  
i am creating new environment using YML

 
[?4/?8/?2019 1:42 PM]  
*oscir
 
[?4/?8/?2019 1:42 PM]  Anujay Saraf:  
not sure whats the issue

[?4/?8/?2019 2:54 PM]  Anujay Saraf:  
he is using pre trained models
 
[?4/?8/?2019 2:54 PM]  Anujay Saraf:  
Download the pre-trained models. The total download size will be of around 5 GB. Do: 
mkdir skip-thoughts/models
wget -P ./skip-thoughts/models http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/dictionary.txt
wget -P ./skip-thoughts/models http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/utable.npy
wget -P ./skip-thoughts/models http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/btable.npy
wget -P ./skip-thoughts/models http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/uni_skip.npz
wget -P ./skip-thoughts/models http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/uni_skip.npz.pkl

i guess more practical this is
 
[?4/?8/?2019 2:56 PM]  Anujay Saraf:  
yes
but you have the train the model for the weights
like he did
 
[?4/?8/?2019 3:01 PM]  
haan
i will put in csv
and then read
*put in text
 
[?4/?8/?2019 3:02 PM]  Anujay Saraf:  
rather then putting take in JSON
then directly use it there
why to do double work
 
[?4/?8/?2019 3:03 PM]
